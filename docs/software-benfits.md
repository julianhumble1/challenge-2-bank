# **Bank Software Documentation**

### Aims and benefits of this software

This software is being made at the request of the client, a major bank, to allow customers to remotely create and manage bank accounts with the client.

The principle users of the software will be customers of the bank. The key functionality we are looking to provide these customers with is to withdraw money from their account, deposit money into their account, and to see a statement of the details of all previous withdrawals and deposits into their account.

The main benefits of the software to the customer include:
* **Access their money from anywhere** - customers of the bank will be able to either withdraw or deposit money to their account from anywhere (on their phones or computers) rather than having to be in a bank or at an ATM machine. This will give them the freedom to do their banking in their own time, and give them more time to do the other things in their life, such as spending time with their family.
* **Keep track of all of their payments** - customers will be able to use the statement to track their spending, and that will help them spot patterns in their spending and eventually save more money by cutting out unnecessary costs.
