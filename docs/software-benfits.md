### Aims and benefits of this software

This software is being made at the request of the client, a major bank, to allow customers to remotely create and manage bank accounts with the client.

The principle users of the software will be customers of the bank. The key functionality we are looking to provide these customers with is to withdraw money from their account, deposit money into their account, and to see a statement of the details of all previous withdrawals and deposits into their account.

The main benefits of the software to the customer include:
* **Access their money from anywhere** - customers of the bank will be able to either withdraw or deposit money to their account from anywhere (on their phones or computers) rather than having to be in a bank or at an ATM machine. This will give them the freedom to do their banking in their own time, and give them more time to do the other things in their life, such as spending time with their family.
* **Keep track of all of their payments** - customers will be able to use the statement to track their spending, and that will help them spot patterns in their spending and eventually save more money by cutting out unnecessary costs.

Additional benefits of the software to the client include:
* **More customers** - because of the ease and convenience the software will provide to the users, there will be a huge shift of customers opening accounts with the client, so that they can take advantage of the great benefits. This will lead to a boost in revenue for the client, which in turn will improve their profits, both in the long and short term.
* **Reduced operating expenses** - given that the client's customers will be able to do a huge amount of their basic banking remotely, the client will be able to roll back some of their operation in brick & mortar branches and ATMs. This could mean reducing the number of staff, reducing opening hours, or moving to smaller units, which could lead to huge savings in operating expenses for the client.

There could be some potential risks or drawbacks to implementing this software, including:
* **Security Risks** - due to the nature of the client's business being a bank, it is highly essential that the software must be totally and completely secure, impervious to any digital attacks that any hackers or thieves may attempt to steal the customers' money. This could be considered less secure than more traditional banking methods.
* **User Confusion** - some users who may be less familiar with using digital apps, such as the elderly, may be prone to mistakes that they wouldn't otherwise make in a more normal bank setting. If they were to accidentally send money to the wrong account, there may be no way for them to recover that money.
